            We're committed to providing a secure and fair marketplace for our
            buyers and sellers. To support this commitment, we've put in place
            rules and policies that govern our expectations of buyers and
            sellers, the actions we'll take to keep you safe, and how we'll
            protect you if something goes wrong. By becoming familiar with and
            following our policies, you'll help us maintain a safe environment
            for all, and be able to avoid interruptions that might come from
            inadvertent violations of our rules. Some of our rules reflect local
            legal requirements, while others are based on our experience of how
            best to protect everyone using iAdvertise.store services. In our
            policy section, you'll find information on items that can and can't
            be sold, guides to creating and maintaining listings, details on how
            we protect your personal details and more. You can also find our
            User Agreement, User Privacy Notice, and Cookie Notice. These lay
            out the most critical information around our terms of use, the
            information we collect from you, and how we keep that information
            safe.

            At iAdvertise.store, we have policies to ensure our platform remains
            a trusted and inclusive environment for our global community of
            buyers and sellers. Although most adult-only items are prohibited,
            listings that show nudity are allowed in limited situations when
            they follow the guidelines below.
            <br />
            <br />
            We're committed to preventing bias in the application of our
            policies. All forms of adult content that don't follow our policy
            will be removed. We'll review the content of the listing, images,
            and the category of the items to determine if it is allowed. <br />
